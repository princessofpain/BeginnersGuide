# BeginnersGuide
Currently I read the book [Java: A Beginner's Guide, Seventh Edition 7th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Seventh-Herbert-Schildt/dp/1259589315) to enhance my Java skills. I use this repo to collect small applications and to play around.

## Packages
### UsingIO
The 10th chapter of the book deals with I/O in Java.

#### ByteInput
Try out the class InputStream and the methods `int read()`, `int read(byte b[])` and `int available()`.

#### Functions
- getLengthOfInputStream()
- readOneByteOfInputStream()
- readAllBytesOfInputStream()
- readBytes()
- convertBytesToChars(byte allBytes[])
- display(byte[] allBytes, char[] allLetters)

## How to set it up
Download or clone the repo. I use Eclipse, but other IDEs may work similar. Simply create a new project and import the repo in this project. Run the application with the functionality provided by the IDE.
